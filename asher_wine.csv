Schlossgut Diel,,"Description

This exceptional dry white wine was first created in 1994 for the Business Class of Lufthansa and has now become the distinctive “business card” of Schlossgut Diel. It perfectly combines the difference in characters of the grape varieties involved in this special cuvée: while the Pinot Gris shows  abundance and spice and the Pinot Blanc plays the elegant part, the Riesling provides the invigorating freshness. A wonderful refreshing wine, which gives a lot of pleasure while drinking.
HARVEST
A selective handpicking of Grapes from our own vineyards
WINE MAKING
Carefully pressing of the whole grapes. Fermentation and storage are in stainless steel tanks and wood barrels made of oak from the local forest.

The Characteristics
A classic Dead Arm in every sense of the word. The nose is brooding and
alluring, earthy notes combined with dark fruits, fennel and baking spice. The
longer this wine sits in the glass, the further it unfurls opening into notes of
sweeter berry fruit laced with more of those soily, forest floor notes.
The palate is dense and concentrated with a plethora of fruit characters, plum,
blackberry, mulberry, earth, iodine and black olive. Despite the richness and
intensity of the attack and mid palate the experience surprisingly crescendos
with a lick of spicey pepper, coupled with lovely, fined grained, textural tannins
that seem to persist in the mouth forever. Complex, savoury and moreish!",D’Arenberg Icons The Dead Arm Shiraz,0,60,"Pre-Order

The Name
Dead Arm is a vine disease caused by the
fungus Eutypa Lata that randomly affects
vineyards all over the world. Often vines
affected are severely pruned or replanted. One
half, or an ‘arm’ of the vine slowly becomes
reduced to dead wood. That side may be
lifeless and brittle, but the grapes on the other
side, while low yielding, display amazing
intensity.",https://www.asherbws.com/product/darenberg-dead-arm-shiraz/

Jules Taylor,,"Description

The vintage began with a warm dry spring allowing for strong growth and providing the perfect conditions for the first half of flowering. Cooler temperatures towards the end of the flowering period reduced the fruit set which lead to moderate sized yields being set for the season ahead. A near drought prevailed during the following month until rain in late January saved the growing season giving the vines a well-earned boost going into verasion. The fruit was slower to ripen this year but was able to reach physiological ripeness at a lower sugar level creating a lovely balance in acidity.
Tasting Notes:
colour: Bright and lively ruby red
nose:This fruit-driven Pinot Noir is generous on the nose showing dark cherry, black doris plum, and vibrant red raspberry and cranberry aromas which gradually open to reveal subtle dried thyme notes and hints of cocoa.
palate:With a palate full of vibrant bright fruit, this wine exhibits plum, cherry and cranberry flavours, well balanced with earthy, savoury undertones with a delightful layer of chocolate.",Jules Taylor – The Better Half Pinot Noir,0,31,NOTE: Actual wine vintage may differ from the image shown (due to time of image taken).

Sterling Vineyards,,"Description

Sterling Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon
Sterling Vineyards, one of Napa Valley’s premier winery destinations, offers an array of distinct and beautifully crafted wines from its home appellation. The Sterling Vineyards Napa Valley wines show the depth, strength and incredible quality representative of California’s most famous wine region. The grapes for Sterling Vineyards Napa Valley wines are grown in 14 diverse and premium vineyards throughout the valley – from the cool southern Carneros region to the warm and rugged northernmost reaches of the valley near Calistoga. These incredible vineyards give Winemaker Harry Hansen some of the best Napa Valley fruit to select from and craft these unique, intensely flavoured and expressive wines.
Cabernet Sauvignon reigns king in the Napa Valley and the appellation excels in producing outstanding expressions of this admired varietal. Napa Valley offers an ideal combination of topography, geology and climate that enables this varietal to reach optimum ripeness, balance and finesse. The Calistoga appellation is one of the warmest areas in the valley but has extreme diurnal shifts, allowing the grapes to enjoy very cool nights which help maintain excellent acidity.
The Sterling Vineyards Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is a brooding, dark garnet-red color in the glass with big fruit aromas of blackberry jam, rice plum and notes of cassis. The nose leads to a full-bodied, concentrated, richly textured palate with flavours of dried black cherry, warm caramel and a pleasing umami character. The wine is dense and offers striking fruit intensity balanced with good acidity and fine, well-integrated tannins. The wine is seamless and offers a lengthy finish that hints at its ability to age for at least the next 10 to 15 years.",Sterling Vineyards Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,0,45.6,"Cabernet Sauvignon

mainly Pinot Noir (40-50%), winey and angular, for its intense fruitiness as well as for its structure, which integrates the dosage.
Pinot Meunier (30-40%), full and fleshy, for a rich, melting sensation on the mid-palate.
Chardonnay (10-20%) for a refreshing finish.
20 to 30% specially selected reserve wines enhance the assemblage to complete its intensity, richness and constancy.

Beni Di Batasiolo,,"Description

Almost a crypt, where the ancient alchemy of transforming must into fine wines is celebrated. The sanctorum in which the grapes are selected by master vintners, who then heed the boiling of the fermentation in huge oak casks. The destination of the harvests of large estates, where the grapes were delivered once upon a time on carts drawn by horned oxen, whereas now they arrive for pressing only a short time after they have been picked. The winery as it was, with the old oak casks lined up imperiously along faintly-lit corridors. The winery as it is today, adjusted to the needs of an ever more demanding and selective market, in which quality is an unforgivable constant, a pre-requisite for a flawless, stable, homogeneous product. This means state-of-the-art equipment, and access to the most appropriate technologies. The new look, which stands alongside the old rather than its place, is one shiny steel, and electronically-controlled, automatic processes.",Beni Di Batasiolo Barolo (DOCG) 2015,0,74,NOTE: Actual wine vintage may differ from the image shown (due to time of image taken).

Perrier Jouet,,"Description

Last October, The House of Perrier-Jouët welcomed the autumn season with the launch of the limited edition Belle Epoque Edition Automne 2005 in Singapore.
Autumn is one of the most dazzling and enthralling seasons. With flaming reds, glistening yellows, oranges and rustic browns and the gentle bathing of light on vast landscapes, it presents an almost picture perfect image of the season. It is no wonder that one can’t help but be taken in by this season of enchantment.
Perrier-Jouët Cellar Master Hervé Deschamps was so mesmerized by the beauty of Autumn that he decided to create a special seasonal cuvée in tribute to the colours of fall with the Belle Epoque Edition Automne 2005.
“The richness of the 2005 vintage inspired me to create this cuvée in tribute to autumn’s allure and vitality as a way of savouring the beauty of an ephemeral season.” Says Hervé Deschamps, Perrier -Jouët Cellar Master.
Bringing together a unique blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, Deschamps has created a rare, ephemeral cuvée like no other. It is a marriage of allure, voluptuousness and vitality that conveys all the elements of this season of enchantment. This ephemeral cuvée is unique to the Perrier-Jouët brand, the only known champagne house to create bespoke cuvées inspired by the seasons and nature.",Perrier Jouet Belle Epoque Edition Automne 2005,0,334.58,"Limited Edition. 50 Bottles Left
