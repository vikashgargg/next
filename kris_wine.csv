The estate is located in the Uco Valley at the foothills of the Andes and encompasses 115 acres of still young vines. The consulting winemaker is Michel Rolland. At the beginning of the 20th century, Paul Cuvelier and his young brother Albert, anticipating the inevitable rise in ""Chateau-bottled wines"" to the detriment of the ""tailor-made"" blends of the wine merchants, decided to purchase top quality estates in the Bordeaux area.

DOMAINES BARONS DE ROTHSCHILD,"Product Weight1.3 kgFor its tenth anniversary, Bodegas CARO chose to celebrate the grape that has come to symbolize Argentina’s vineyards by selecting a pure Malbec: ARUMA! Originally from France, Malbec (Cahors) was introduced to Argentina by a Frenchman, Jean Pouget, in 1868, which coincidentally was the same year James de Rothschild purchased Château Lafite. A very fruity, exuberant, powerful grape, Malbec has adapted wonderfully to the Mendoza region where the sunshine and cool nights soften its tannins and reveal its velvety-smoothness. “ARUMA” means the “night” in the language of the Quechua, the native Indians of the Mendoza region. We chose this name because it is the intense darkness of the nights in the Andes and the pure mountain air that give the wines the rich, authentic character of their terroir. ARUMA - the wine of the mountain nights.Tasting Notes : The robe is deep red with hints of violet. The nose reveals aromas of plum and red fruit.

TERROIR AL LIMIT,"Product Weight1.5 kgAfter several years experimenting with different casks, sizes and producers, we now work with a combination of 500-litre barrels and different sizes of Stockinger, thus guaranteeing the most respectful elevage to allow the wine to rest before early bottling. We prefer bottling the wines in a rather reductive state with some hints of gas and lots of life. This means they are very fresh and vital when put into the bottle, resulting in a fresh, straightforward wine which is tight and has lots of tension.Tasting NotesThere are strong notes of licorice, red berries and Mediterranean herbs, and it's aromatic, expressive, open, clean and, frankly, very attractive. Like many 2017s, it doesn't show any heat or excess ripeness. The oak foudres are getting older every year and lend less and less aromas and flavors, and the wines feel purer and purer.

Consistently rating as one the top Rieslings in New Zealand this wine has developed a cult following over the years. Delicious as a young wine, it’s also a Riesling that will age for 15+ years.

It’s a great example of the style that Central Otago produces so well. The grapes for this wine were cropped at a low 3.6-5 tonnes per hectare and most of the wine cool fermented in stainless steel to retain varietal purity and just over 26% wild fermented in neutral French oak barrels to enhance the mineral and flint characters - which also balance the wine’s sweetness.

BOTTEGA SPA,"Product Weight9.6 kgThe main purpose of “organic winegrowing” is soil management: its natural fertility is guaranteed by maintaining humus and active microorganisms, and enriching it with nutrients. In organic winegrowing, allowed substances include natural fertilizers, minerals from natural sources, plant byproducts, algae and microelement. “Chemistry” is basically forbidden in the vineyard. Therefore, Bottega uses exhausted pomace to mulch the rows, protecting roots and avoiding the growth of unwanted plants, thus making the herbicides unnecessary. Grapes are grown in an area where the microclimate is ideal for Glera grapes, with perfect temperature, humidity, exposure and supply of water and nutrients. The climate is characterized by long but quite mild winters and hot, though not sultry, summers. The high day-to-night temperature excursion leads to fines, more elegant and intense aromas.Tasting Note : Bouquet: elegantly floral and fruity, with clear hints of ripe apple.

shades. The palate is exceptionally precise, with the various elements
concentrated to the point of retaining only the wine’s essence: a powdery and

The classification of the Grands Crus Classés, prepared on the 1855 Universal Exhibition in Paris, officially ranked Château Lafite Rothschild as the ""Premier des Premiers"". The 110 hectare vineyard consists of three main areas: the slopes around the Château, the adjacent Carruades plateau to the west and a 4.5 hectare plot in the neighbouring commune of Saint Estèphe. The vines are planted in well-drained and well-exposed soil made up of fine, deep gravel, mixed with aeolian sand on a subsoil of tertiary limestone. The average age of the vines is 45 years for the Grand Vin; the oldest plot, ""La Gravière"", was planted in 1886.  Tasting NotesBeautiful dark red colour with almost black glints in the glass. The wine is bright and clear. Very dark. The nose is still very closed, but all the signs of tremendous aromatic potential are present: the depth, complexity and the already perfectly integrated oak from the barrel ageing. Some classic notes of violet, but all still very contained. On the palate the attack is very soft and silky. Then gradually, maintaining the same softness, the wine fills the mouth with enormous length, to the point that one wonders how long it can continue! The mid-palate is perfectly balanced. It is very dense with tight tannins that are still very delicate. The wine has remarkable persistence and fullness on the palate, it does not reveal the slightest imbalance or weakness.

TERROIR AL LIMIT,"Product Weight1.5 kgAfter several years experimenting with different casks, sizes and producers, we now work with a combination of 500-litre barrels and different sizes of Stockinger, thus guaranteeing the most respectful elevage to allow the wine to rest before early bottling. Terra de Cuques is bottled after around 16 months of ageing.Tasting NotesThe white 2017 Terra de Cuques Blanc has a marine nose with hints of iodine and salt, slowly showing some white fruit, Mediterranean herbs, fennel and dry stones. Even if 2017 was a warmer year, this blend of 90% Pedro Ximénez and 10% Moscatel kept its alcohol at 13.5%. The skin contact was shortened, and the wine is subtler and finer, with ultra fine tannins and a textured mouthfeel. This is also cleaner, with less lees aromas, and the wine is sharp and more defined. I'd never say this is a warm vintage.

DOMAINE ROMANEE CONTI,"Product Weight7.5 kgDomaine de la Romanee-Conti, often abbreviated to DRC, is an
estate in Burgundy, France that produces white and red wine. It is widely
considered among the world's greatest wine producers, and DRC bottles are among
the world's most expensive. It takes its name from the domaine's most famous
vineyard, Romanee-Conti Which lies on brown limestone soils 60 cm deep with a
major clay component.
Tasting Notes
As is often the case in its youth, this easily possesses the most aromatic
breadth of any wine in the range with an utterly kaleidoscopic nose that
incorporates notes of Asian spice box elements, rose petal, lavender, lilac,
orange pekoe tea and sandalwood. There is superb richness to the powerfully
constituted flavors that possess outstanding delineation and intensity while
displaying perhaps even more minerality than usual, all wrapped in a mildly
warm finish that slowly fans out as it sits on the palate. This is one classy
wine that manages to do what only the greatest of burgundies can, which is to
wow you with its power without weight mouth palate impression. And if all of
this weren't enough, the refinement and poise here are nothing short of
riveting. While I am very careful when it comes to proclaiming that such and
such a vintage of La Tâche will go down as one of the all-time greats, the 2015
version appears to have the potential to be one of them. Time will of course be
the final arbiter but the underlying material is so good it's difficult to be
less than super-enthusiastic. 98 points Allen Meadows.

DOMAINES BARONS DE ROTHSCHILD,"Product Weight1.3 kg2017 was characterized in Bordeaux by a very
uniform climate, resulting in a good quality vintage for the entire region. Bud
break occurred around the normal time, although the spring was rather rainy and
cold. June was particularly overcast and cool, but flowering nevertheless took
place in good conditions. The summer was hot and very dry, almost too dry at
the beginning of September, with ripening becoming hindered in some cases due
to water stress. Lafite’s superb terroir was perfectly able to cope with these
conditions, and to wait for the welcome rain on 13 September. This created
optimal conditions for the final ripening of the grapes, ready to reach
exceptional levels of maturity.

Tasting Notes

fruit dominated by cherry. There are also notes of tobacco, which is quite unusual at this
stage of the ageing process. On the palate, the wine quickly opens, which is often the case

outstanding AOC of the Médoc. The Pichon Baron estate, overlooking the Latour

has striven to do so with constancy and excellence in line with this vineyard's
early history. Its old vines produce in small quantities but are of supreme
quality. The great terroir comprising the 30-hectare plateau of Pichon Baron

first produced in 1694) is devoted entirely to production of the Grand Vin and

MISHA'S VINEYARD,"Product Weight1.2 kgThis style of Pinot Noir has been crafted with a light touch and displays a wonderful silken-texture with a sweet-fruited palate but still has a distinct touch of complexity. Michael Cooper who writes “The Buyer’s Guide to New Zealand Wine” has rated this 4.5 stars and says ”skilfully crafted and very harmonious, it offers good value”. This lighter and fruitier style of Pinot Noir, which can be served slightly cool, is going to be a great partner with chicken or lamb briyani, Cantonese dim sum, Japanese Tempura or just with roast pork or char-siew. Tasting NotesDeep purple-red in colour, this Pinot Noir has an expressive nose of ripe summer fruits with spice and coffee notes, a concentrated silky palate and a sweet fruit finish. From the warm 2018 vintage (in fact one of the warmest on record in Central Otago), the grapes for this Pinot Noir were all hand-picked and fermented in small lots with some portion of whole bunches. The Pinot Noir was aged in French oak barriques for 10 months and this final blend was determined by selecting certain barrels. With 13.5% alcohol, the Pinot Noir received just minimal filtering prior to bottling. Grape Variety100% Pinot Noir.CountryNew Zealand.Size750 ml.",MISHA'S VINEYARD 'IMPROMPTU' - CENTRAL OTAGO - 2018,,64,"The name of this wine, Impromptu, is meant to reflect its style.

This style of Pinot Noir is crafted to be enjoyed now – or any time the need arises! It is beautifully fruited with dark cherry, sweet raspberry and floral aromas making it immediate appealing. Receiving 91/100 points from Bob Campbell MW, it represents incredible value for a Central Otago Pinot Noir. Spectacularly located on the edge of Lake Dunstan in the Bendigo sub-region of Central Otago, the 57-hectare single-vineyard Misha’s Vineyard estate provides optimal conditions for producing world-class Pinot Noir and aromatic white varieties and was named one of New Zealand's Top 20 Wine Producers (Decanter, UK).Read more",https://www.krisshop.com/en/product/d68b50ae06781be5/misha-s-vineyard-impromptu-central-otago-2018.html
MISHA'S VINEYARD,"Product Weight1.3 kgThis is a wine that is often selected for international tastings as an exemplary style of Pinot Gris from New Zealand. In Michael Cooper’s “Buyer’s Guide to New Zealand Wine”, this wine has a 5-star rating and has achieved that every vintage over the past ten years and has achieved a “Classic” wine status. Cooper says “…Made in an off-dry style it is highly scented and strongly varietal... mouth-filling, with rich, vibrant pear, lychee and spice flavours, a very subtle oak influence, fresh, balanced acidity and a very harmonious finish.”. This is a wine that is perfect to enjoy with many Asian stir-fries or dishes with a little spice. It’s also great with shellfish, salmon, pork dishes or creamy-sauce pasta dishes. Tasting NotesOff-dry in style (6.3 g/l) and showing classic varietal notes of pear, red apple, cinnamon and lifted sweet ﬂoral aromatics, the palate has a complex blend of jasmine, nectarine and ginger with notes of mint and lime. The 2020 vintage was a perfect season providing ideal conditions for flowering and fruit-set with wonderful growth. The fruit for this wine was hand-picked with over 40% being fermented in older French oak hogshead barrels with indigenous yeast to add more complexity and build the mid-palate texture to the wine.

CHAMPAGNE DELAMOTTE,"Product Weight1.3 kgDelamotte was founded in Reims in 1760 by François Delamotte, a
vineyard owner. At more than 250 years old, it is the fifth oldest house in
Champagne. The House was sold to the Lanson family in the 1830s, who later
started producing a Lanson label. It was eventually acquired by Marie-Louise de
Nonancourt, née Lanson, in the period between the two World Wars. In 1927,
Marie-Louise made the decision to transfer the activities of the house of
Delamottte to Le Mesnil-sur-Oger. The management of the company was entrusted
to the capable hands of Marie-Louise’s youngest son, Charles de Nonancourt. It
was Charles who established the golden rules for the business: ensure a
consistent quality by purposefully limiting production and maintain at least
three harvests in the cellars always. In 1988, the House of Delamotte joined
forces with the still enigmatic Champagne Salon under the umbrella of the
parent company, Laurent-Perrier, led by Charles’ brother, Bernard. Today, the

CHATEAU LEOVILLE POYFERRE,"Product Weight1.2 kgChateau Leoville Poyferre was the Leoville that got left in the
starting blocks in terms of reputation and in the quality of its wines.
Leoville Poyferre has been owned by the Cuvelier family (who also own Château
Le Crock) since 1921, yet it was not until the 1970s, when Didier Cuvelier took
control at the château, that quality began to improve. In the last 20 years,
Didier, with the assistance of Michel Rolland since 1995, has turned Leoville-Poyferre
into one of St-Julien's finest estates. Leoville Poyferre has 80 hectares of
vineyards. Leoville Poyferre traditionally produced the softest and most supple
wine of the 3 Leovilles, yet in the last decade the wines have definitely put
on weight and body. This is largely due to the grapes being harvested riper and
later and because of the increased exposure to new oak in the maturation
process. Now up with the best of the St-Juliens but still selling at non-scary
prices. Leoville Poyferre is classified as a 2ème Cru Classe.

Tasting Notes
In spite of the generous ripe fruit, this also
has the cool elegance and slightly austere finish of St.-Julien. Considerable
intensity without any sense of heaviness make this an impressive example of
modern winemaking. Second wine of Château Leoville Poyferre.

Beautiful dark colour with glints of violet and black. Very fine
complex, delicate nose, despite the wine’s youth. The oak and toasted notes
blend perfectly with the freshness, reflecting well-managed barrel-ageing. On
the palate, the attack is pure and delicate. Initially slightly closed, the
wine gradually invades the palate, evolving with substantial volume, but never
becoming aggressive. This creates a sensation of both power and lightness. The
Cabernet Sauvignon develops more density towards the end of the mid-palate.

CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC,"Product Weight1.3 kgThe present-day Cheval Blanc vineyards had vines at least as far
back as the 18th century, as shown by Belleyme's map of the region dated 1764.
Nearly a century later, the estate was acquired by the Fourcaud-Laussac family
who owned it until 1998, when it was sold to Mr Bernard Arnault and Baron
Albert Frère. The vineyard is in a single block, and borders on the Pomerol
appellation. An outstanding terror and unusual proportions of Cabernet Franc
and Merlot give this great wine a unique flavor. Chateau Cheval Blanc has had a
greater number of outstanding vintages than any other classified great growth
over the past century. Another unusual characteristic of Cheval Blanc is that
once it reaches its peak, it maintains it for a very long time. This admirable
wine is powerful, soft, rich, round and silky. It has tremendous fruit and
elegance as well as exceptional quality from year to year.

Tasting Notes
Medium to deep garnet in color, the 2011 Cheval
Blanc features a nose of warm mulberries, preserved plums and figs with
suggestions of dried herbs, dusty soil and underbrush plus a touch of Sichuan
pepper. Medium to full-bodied, taut and muscular in the mouth, it has a solid
frame of chewy tannins supporting the restrained fruit and a long earth and
Provence herbs-layered finish.

who owned it until 1998, when it was sold to Mr Bernard Arnault and Baron
Albert Frère. The vineyard is in a single block, and borders on the Pomerol
appellation. An outstanding terror and unusual proportions of Cabernet Franc
and Merlot give this great wine a unique flavor. Chateau Cheval Blanc has had a
greater number of outstanding vintages than any other classified great growth
over the past century. Another unusual characteristic of Cheval Blanc is that
once it reaches its peak, it maintains it for a very long time. This admirable
wine is powerful, soft, rich, round and silky. It has tremendous fruit and
elegance as well as exceptional quality from year to year.Read more",https://www.krisshop.com/en/product/c5e7aebfa6c1bded/chateau-cheval-blanc-saint-emilion.html

CHATEAU PETRUS,"Product Weight1.3 kgPetrus is a Bordeaux, France, wine estate located in the Pomerol
appellation near its eastern border to Saint-Emilion. A small estate of just
11.4 hectares (28 acres), it produces a red wine entirely from Merlot grapes
(since the end of 2010), and produces no second wine. The estate belongs to
Jean-François Moueix and his children. Although the wines of Pomerol have never
been classified, Petrus is widely regarded as the outstanding wine of the appellation.
Petrus leads a duo of Pomerol estates in extreme prices, along with Le Pin,
that rank consistently among the world's most expensive wines.

Tasting Notes
The dark plum/ruby-tinged 2004 Petrus possesses
high acidity as well as copious amounts of sweet cherries and black currants
intermixed with hints of cola, earth, and truffles. Deep, medium-bodied,
concentrated, ripe flavors are excruciatingly firm and tannic. This backward,
structured, muscular Pomerol requires a decade of cellaring, but it possesses
the potential to be the longest-lived wine of the vintage, lasting 30-40 years.
